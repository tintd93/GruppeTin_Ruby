Project name: RewardPoints

# DESCRIPTION 

Oneliner: Reward points for employes within the company.

A company wants to create a website where their employees aside from monthly sallery also recieves reward points.
The reward points is used on the website to purcase products as a bonus. However it's just a limited list of items
the company will buy in large amounts to get a better price. The website will have a login/registrer function so
each employee have to registrer a user. When logged the user can check the list of items and buy whatever as long
as they can afford it. Each user will get the same amount of reward points each month. 
The company should be able to add new items/cost of the item. 

# Things i would do diffrently:

User would have to have a company - email to register.
We would actually use the postal code/adress in the developement to deliver the product
Use a better server.
Change the overall look of the product. This project i mainly focus on the function.

# Things i missed:
I dont have a design of which api i would use because i dont know yet which and every api i will use to develope this, thus
it would be a bad manual and never used.
